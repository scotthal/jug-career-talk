# Software Careers in Down Times

https://scotthal.github.io/jug-career-talk

<!--

I'm going to be talking about managing your software career during a "down
time," or a time when it is generally difficult to find a job.

You might be thinking, "This guy is nuts.  There's more money sloshing around in
the industry than ever!"

True, but if you haven't demonstrated proficiency in a very narrow set of
skills, there's a good chance you've either been laid off, or are very worried
that you soon might be laid off.  If you don't currently have a job, or don't
like the job you have, you're likely finding it difficult to find a position.
That's what I mean by a "down time."

The good news is that the most effective strategies for competing in down times
are no different from the most effective strategies for standing out from the
crowd in good times.  What changes is that the penalties for failing to use
these strategies are much harsher in down times.

# Hi.  I'm Scott.

scott@hallocks.net

# <- Signal

I'm sometimes
[bad at email](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html).

<!--

I have been in this business for 30 years, as an individual contributor and a
leader, at every conceivable level of abstraction from embedded to Java
application servers.

You should listen to me because I have been an interviewer and a hiring manager
at Qualcomm, at Amazon, and at Google.

You should _not_ listen to me because I have been (mostly voluntarily)
unemployed for the last two years.  I refer to myself as, "maybe retired but
definitely grumpy."

We'll get a little bit into why I'm grumpy in a second, though I promise not to
turn this talk into a gripe session.

# Consider Your Values

<!--

You need to understand your values to manage your career effectively.  This
sounds more touchy-feely than practical.  In my years as a manager, I ran a
number of performance improvement plans and involuntary exits.

If you're not working on something you value, or if your values clash with the
organization in which you're working, you won't do your best work.  If you have
a job, your career will stagnate.  If you don't have a job, your lack of
enthusiasm will come through in your interview performance.

I have direct experience with both.

s a manager in Boulder, I frequently encountered people who wanted to transfer
out of either the Bay Area or New York City, and who "didn't care" what they'd
be working on, so long as it was in Boulder.  They quickly realized they didn't
value what they work working on.  Their performance flagged.  More than one
involuntary exit resulted.

My values are currently in conflict with a those of a lot of Big Tech.  I have
actually interviewed for a few positions in the last two years.  My lack of
enthusiasm came through in the interviews.  I didn't get offers.

# Consider Your Values

Your _actual_ values, not those imposed on you by others.

<!--

Figuring out what you value is harder than it might first seem.  There are many
people and groups in your life, many of whom you want to please, who have strong
opinions about what your values ought to be.

Unfortunately for them, the only person who can determine your values is you.
You need to spend some introspective time figuring what your _actual_ values
are, as distinct from what you and others in your life might wish that they are.

# Consider Your Values

- What were you working on when you did your best work?
  - What was your task?
  - What was the work situation?
  - Who were you working with?
  - Who were you working for?
- What kind of work has sent you into a flow state?
- What kinds of side projects do you gravitate to?

<!--

We're all, myself included, pretty good at fooling ourselves as to our
values. Here are some open-ended questions you can think about to help pull your
blindfold off and see yourself clearly.

# Consider Employer Values

<!--

Some of us are very excited about what large technology employers are up to.
Some of us are skeptical.  Some of us are _definitely_ grumpy.

I'm not here to dictate your values to you.

Large technology employers have, through their recent actions, made it _very_
clear what they value and what they don't.

Google used to say, "Respect the user.  Respect the opportunity.  Respect each
other."  I'll leave it as an exercise for you to determine which of those still
hold.  I know you can do it!

This is actually great news.  You now have a _very_ clear picture of the values
held by the largest technology employers.  No one is out there thinking, "Gosh,
I wonder what Nvidia _really_ values!"

Once you've determined your values, you can compare them to those of the
employer you're chasing.  If your values are in conflict, and you want to chase
them, anyway, I certainly won't judge.  Everyone needs to work.  At least you're
going in with your eyes open.

# Why Does Anyone Hire?

<!--

Ok, Scott.  Enough with the psychology.  How do I get hired?

As a former hiring manager, I can tell you that hiring kinda sucks.  I love the
part where I get to meet and learn about new people.  I don't so much like the
hours of paperwork, all done knowing the risk that I might still be hiring the
wrong person.

So why hire at all?

In short, a hiring manager needs someone to solve an underspecified problem,
end-to-end, with minimal oversight.  At larger companies, the hiring cycles are
agonizingly long.  Hiring managers know that the problem that needs to be solve
may well _completely change_ between the interview and the new hire's first day.

You need to convince the hiring manager that you are _the_ person who can do
that, ideally _before the interview even happens_.

How do you do that?

# Meet People

<!--

If you're in person at [B|D]JUG tonight, congratulation!  You're already doing
this.  You're going out and meeting people.  Try to talk to someone you don't
know, tonight.

I don't like the term, "Networking," because a lot of people seem to think that
showing up in person and handing out some business cards means they've checked
the networking box.  Then they're disappointed when it doesn't result in job
offers rolling in.

You still have to convince the people you meet that you can solve problems for
them.

That said, don't negate what you've done being here, tonight.  It's a difficult
and great first step!

# Be Generous

<!--

Scott, you're getting squishy again.  Where's the hard-nosed, concrete advice
about how to.  Get.  The.  Job.

Hear me out.

Especially in a down time like today, your goal is to get as many people as
possible to associate your face and your name with the idea that _you solve
underspecified problems with minimal oversight_.

How do you do that?  It couldn't be more obvious!  You do that by figuring out
what their problems are and solving them with minimal oversight, expecting
nothing in return.

That's called, "being generous."

You do not have to limit yourself to technical tasks, here.  Remember, hiring
managers have _underspecified_ problems that _they know will change before your
first day._

Much of what you do as a practitioner will not be strictly technical.  There are
vanishly few strictly technical problems in business.

No problem you solve for others is a waste of time.  Every problem you solve
cements your name and face in someone's mind as a problem solver.
