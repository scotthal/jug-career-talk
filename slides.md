# Software Careers in Down Times

https://scotthal.github.io/jug-career-talk

<!--
I'm going to be talking about managing your software career during a "down
time," or a time when it is generally difficult to find a job.

You might be thinking, "This guy is nuts.  There's more money sloshing around in
the industry than ever!"

True, but if you haven't demonstrated proficiency in a very narrow set of
skills, there's a good chance you've either been laid off, or are very worried
that you soon might be laid off.  If you don't currently have a job, or don't
like the job you have, you're likely finding it difficult to find a position.
That's what I mean by a "down time."

The good news is that the most effective strategies for competing in down times
are no different from the most effective strategies for standing out from the
crowd in good times.  What changes is that the penalties for failing to use
these strategies are much harsher in down times.

# Hi.  I'm Scott.

# <- Signal

I'm sometimes
[bad at email](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html).

<!--
I have been in this business for 30 years, as an individual contributor and a
leader, at every conceivable level of abstraction from embedded to Java
application servers.

You should listen to me because I have been an interviewer and a hiring manager
at Qualcomm, at Amazon, and at Google.

You should _not_ listen to me because I have been (mostly voluntarily)
unemployed for the last two years.  I refer to myself as, "maybe retired but
definitely grumpy."

We'll get a little bit into why I'm grumpy in a second, though I promise not to
turn this talk into a gripe session.
