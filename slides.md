# Software Careers in Down Times

https://scotthal.github.io/jug-career-talk

<!--
I'm going to be talking about managing your software career during a "down
time," or a time when it is generally difficult to find a job.

You might be thinking, "This guy is nuts.  There's more money sloshing around in
the industry than ever!"

True, but if you haven't demonstrated proficiency in a very narrow set of
skills, there's a good chance you've either been laid off, or are very worried
that you soon might be laid off.  If you don't currently have a job, or don't
like the job you have, you're likely finding it difficult to find a position.
That's what I mean by a "down time."

The good news is that the most effective strategies for competing in down times
are no different from the most effective strategies for standing out from the
crowd in good times.  What changes is that the penalties for failing to use
these strategies are much harsher in down times.

# Hi.  I'm Scott.

# <- Signal

I'm sometimes
[bad at email](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/email.html).

<!--
I have been in this business for 30 years, as an individual contributor and a
leader, at every conceivable level of abstraction from embedded to Java
application servers.

You should listen to me because I have been an interviewer and a hiring manager
at Qualcomm, at Amazon, and at Google.

You should _not_ listen to me because I have been (mostly voluntarily)
unemployed for the last two years.  I refer to myself as, "maybe retired but
definitely grumpy."

We'll get a little bit into why I'm grumpy in a second, though I promise not to
turn this talk into a gripe session.

# Consider Your Values

<!--
You need to understand your values to manage your career effectively.  This
sounds more touchy-feely than practical.  In my years as a manager, I ran a
number of performance improvement plans and involuntary exits.

If you're not working on something you value, or if your values clash with the
organization in which you're working, you won't do your best work.  If you have
a job, your career will stagnate.  If you don't have a job, your lack of
enthusiasm will come through in your interview performance.

I have direct experience with both.

s a manager in Boulder, I frequently encountered people who wanted to transfer
out of either the Bay Area or New York City, and who "didn't care" what they'd
be working on, so long as it was in Boulder.  They quickly realized they didn't
value what they work working on.  Their performance flagged.  More than one
involuntary exit resulted.

My values are currently in conflict with a those of a lot of Big Tech.  I have
actually interviewed for a few positions in the last two years.  My lack of
enthusiasm came through in the interviews.  I didn't get offers.

# Consider Your Values

Your _actual_ values, not those imposed on you by others.

<!--
Figuring out what you value is harder than it might first seem.  There are many
people and groups in your life, many of whom you want to please, who have strong
opinions about what your values ought to be.

Unfortunately for them, the only person who can determine your values is you.
You need to spend some introspective time figuring what your _actual_ values
are, as distinct from what you and others in your life might wish that they are.

# Consider Your Values

- What were you working on when you did your best work?
  - What was your task?
  - What was the work situation?
  - Who were you working with?
  - Who were you working for?
- What kind of work has sent you into a flow state?
- What kinds of side projects do you gravitate to?

<!--
We're all, myself included, pretty good at fooling ourselves as to our
values. Here are some open-ended questions you can think about to help pull your
blindfold off and see yourself clearly.
